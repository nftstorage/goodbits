# goodbits

A list of good things.

## Add to the list

Make a commit adding a line of JSON to [list.ndjson](./list.ndjson). The file format is [newline delimited json](http://ndjson.org/).

Make your entry a JSON object with a `"cid"` property with the [CID](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/content-addressing/) of the resource and a `"tags"` property  to express what kind of goodness should be associated with the CID.
